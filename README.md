# Web Components Test

I'm just experimenting with HTML web components

Go [here](https://joshuajharris.com/web-components-test) to view.

Otherwise,

clone
```
git clone git@github.com:joshuajharris/web-components-test.git
```

install
```
cd web-components-test
npm install
```

and launch
```
npm run start
```

Uses browsersync to launch so a browser should just pop up.
